## Introduction

The Markov Chain Text Composer is a Python program that generates text based on patterns and probabilities learned from a given dataset of text. It uses a simple Markov Chain model to produce new text that resembles the style and content of the training data.

## Features

- Easy-to-use Python script for text generation.
- Customizable Markov Chain order (e.g., bi-grams, tri-grams).
- Training the composer with your own text data.
- Generating new text based on the learned patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markov-chain-text-composer.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Train the composer with your own text data:

   ```python
   from markov_text_composer import MarkovTextComposer
   
   # Create an instance of MarkovTextComposer with your desired order (e.g., order=2 for bi-grams).
   composer = MarkovTextComposer(order=2)
   
   # Provide your training text.
   training_text = "This is your training text. Replace this with your own data."
   
   # Train the composer.
   composer.train(training_text)
   ```

2. Generate new text:

   ```python
   # Generate text of a specified length (e.g., length=100).
   generated_text = composer.generate_text(length=100)
   
   # Print or use the generated_text as needed.
   print(generated_text)
   ```

## Example

Here's a simple example of using the Markov Chain Text Composer:

```python
from markov_text_composer import MarkovTextComposer

composer = MarkovTextComposer(order=2)
training_text = "This is a sample text. This text is used for training the Markov chain text composer."
composer.train(training_text)
generated_text = composer.generate_text(length=50)
print(generated_text)
```
