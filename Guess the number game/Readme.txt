# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the game files.

### Running the Game

Run the following command to start the game:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:

1. You will be prompted to enter a number in the range of 0 to 10.
2. The computer will generate a random number within the same range.
3. The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. You can continue guessing until you guess the correct number.

### Game Logic

- If your guessed number is out of the valid range (0-10), the game will notify you and prompt you to enter a new number.
- If your guessed number is higher than the computer's number, the game will inform you that your guess is too high.
- If your guessed number is lower than the computer's number, the game will inform you that your guess is too low.
- If your guessed number matches the computer's number, the game will display the number of attempts it took you to win.
